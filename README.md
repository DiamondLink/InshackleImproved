# InshackleImproved
Insackle is a set of tools for instagram.
When increasing followers with inshackle, the script can stop due to timeout or instagram's api limit.

This inshackle version improves the "increase follower" function, so the script never stops and you can leave it running for a very long time, and it will bring you thousands of followers

Also, the cookies weren't working well, so they were replaced by credentials.

## Usage
Almost the same as thelinuxchoice's inshackle, the menu is a little bit modified.

## Planned features
I'm planning to add a feature which allows you to chose youre follower's nationality.
