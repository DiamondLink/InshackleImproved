# InshackleImproved
Insackle is a set of tools for instagram.
When increasing followers with inshackle, the script can stop due to timeout or instagram's api limit.

This inshackle version improves the "increase follower" function, so the script never stops and you can leave it running for a very long time, and it will bring you thousands of followers

Also, other cool features were added : you can now chose youre followers nationality. 

## Usage
Almost the same as thelinuxchoice's inshackle, the menu is a little bit modified.
